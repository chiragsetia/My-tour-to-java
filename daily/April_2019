//There are N chocolates on the table. The teacher is distributing the chocolates one by one. Mannerless and hungry children donâ€™t wait for their chance and come again and again for the chocolates. The teacher is looking over this. She scolds a child if at a given time, the child has already taken more chocolates than count of all the chocolates with other children.
