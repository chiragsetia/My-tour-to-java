/*This summer, Ghanshyam is teaching web development to a class of N students. There are K classes in the course. Each day, he comes to the class, he teaches a new topic to the class, about which his students have never heard of. When he doesn’t come to the class, students discuss within themselves all the topics that they know.
For each of the K classes, you are provided with roll numbers of the present participants of the course. Your task is to print the roll numbers of the participants who know all the topics discussed in the course.

/*Target Marbles

At CodingNinjas, we love to play with marbles. We have many marble games, but the most popular one is “Target Marbles”. Now, our marbles are unique. Each marble has a number on it.
In Target Marbles, the player is given a number in the starting and this number is called target. The player is also given N number of marbles to play with. Now, player has to arrange the marbles in a specific way such that sum of the values of at least one of the continuous subset of the arrangement is equal to given target.
Now, NinjaCoder came to play this game and made an arrangement of marbles. The judges of the game need your help. You have to determine if NinjaCoder has won it or not.*/

/*Jumping Game
Level HARD
People of CodingNinjas Land play a jumping game. Let us discuss the rules -
You are given some N boards with one integer written on each board. Now these boards are arranged on ground in line by the judges. The player has to select integers from the given boards such that current selected integer must be greater than previously selected integer i.e. selected integers must be in increasing order.
The player wins if the selected integers add up to form maximum sum possible from the given integers.
Now, you have to help the player in finding the winning sum from given integers.
For Example: Let the given N boards arranged be : [1, 12, 2, 4, 99, 12, 14], then the resultant increasing set of integers with maximum sum would be: [1, 12, 99] and therefore the winning sum is 112.*/
